## To-Do List

Possible features to add/improve within the app.

- [ ] **Email Verification**—adding email/phone verification (OTP, etc..) while registering for voters.
- [ ] **Automated Verification**—adding an automated verification (rather than manually approving by the admin) for the registered users. This could be based on the custom cooperation email, custom list of emails, or custom list of phone numbers, etc.
- [ ] **Report**—option to generate a report at the end of an election. The report could contain a range of information including the number of people that were eligible to vote, the number of people that participated in the election, a bar-chart/pie-chart showing the election statistics, etc.
- [ ] **Workflow improvements**—overall workflow improvements (eg. option to add candidates within the election setup page), with overall GUI improvements.
- [ ] **Multiple election instance**—ability to create multiple election instances without having to re-deploy the smart contract.
